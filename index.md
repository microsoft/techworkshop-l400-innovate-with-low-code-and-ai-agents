## Customer scenario

Zava Oil & Resources, a global energy and resources company with 26,000 employees, operates across multiple countries with a complex safety, compliance, and insurance landscape. Their internal Incident & Claims Management process is outdated spread across spreadsheets, email threads, and siloed applications such as a website for frontline workers to manage their tasks in certain location with poor connectivity, an internal app used by supervisors to track and approve orders that do not integrate with the main ERP system in real time, and risk officers unable to work efficiently due to legacy reporting and analytics tool. 

To modernize their operations and improve both employee productivity and customer interactions, Zava has launched the Zava Claims 360 Modernization Initiative. The initiative focuses on three major business needs.

--- 

### 1. Improving employee efficiency through a modernized internal app 

Frontline field engineers and safety officers frequently submit claims or incident reports using outdated templates and manual processes. These result in: 

- Data duplication 
- Manual re-entry 
- Delayed reporting 
- Inconsistencies across business units 

Zava wants a centralized, modern productivity Power App that simplifies claim entry, triage, document submission, and team collaboration. The goal is to streamline the workflow, reduce administrative overhead, and accelerate response times.

### 2. Enhancing customer & partner experience with an AI-powered agent 

Vendors, contractors, and external partners regularly contact Zava's support desk for updates on claim statuses, required documents, or next steps. This generates a heavy load for back-office teams. 

Zava wants a Copilot Studio agent that can: 

- Answer questions about claim status 
- Help users submit additional information 
- Provide guidance on missing documents 
- Escalate complex issues to a human agent 
- Integrate securely with Zava's Dataverse data 
- Ensure Enterprise-Grade Security, Governance, and ALM

### 3. Compliance, data protection, and change governance

Zava's IT and Security leadership are strict about compliance, data protection, and change governance, especially given the regulated nature of the oil & gas industry. They require: 

- Managed Environments for Dev, UAT, and Prod 
- Dataverse security roles for claims data 
- Solution-based app and agent packaging 
- Power Platform Git integration for source control 
- Automated pipelines to deploy across environments 
- Strict DLP policies to avoid data leakage 
- Maker guardrails and deployment approvals 

This ensures that every app and AI agent is deployed in a secure, governed, and auditable manner-aligning with Zava's enterprise standards and SOC readiness.
